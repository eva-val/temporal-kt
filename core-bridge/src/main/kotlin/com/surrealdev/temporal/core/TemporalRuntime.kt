/**
 * A Temporal Core runtime instance.
 *
 * The runtime is the entry point for all Temporal operations. It manages
 * the underlying Tokio async runtime and provides factory methods for
 * creating clients and workers.
 *
 * Runtimes are thread-safe and should be reused across the application.
 * Creating multiple runtimes is supported but generally unnecessary.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```kotlin
 * TemporalRuntime().use { runtime ->
 *     val client = runtime.createClient(ClientOptions(targetHost = "localhost:7233"))
 *     // Use the client...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @throws TemporalCoreException if runtime creation fails
